# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day "9": May 22, 2017 Monday, 4:44PM

Today's Progress: Refined Shmedium to be central hub for all of my portfolio-related content. (Blog, projects, tutorials,etc)

Thoughts: It's been a few months since I've touched this. Although I have been coding (mainly in C/C++) for school, I haven't been able to play/contribute to my portfolio project. I am planning to use the summer to continue writing, making tutorials, learn angular, participate in meetups, take a summer class.. so this should keep me busy but I am hoping to add a bit more content to the rails-driven site through out the summer months.



### Day 8: February 5, 2017 Monday, 10:50PM

**Today's Progress**: 3 Video walkthroughs on Loops/Loop Patterns in C++ 

**Thoughts**: Had some tough assignments this weekend that I wrapped up this morning along with some great help with my fellow classmates/resources online. C/C++ is challenging, but it's fun. Must. Keep Going.

### Day 5: January 23, Monday, 10:40PM

**Today's Progress**: Full speed ahead with my C Programming class. Taking a break from rails til the weekend most likely, as I want to commit fully to mastering C as much as possible..(I am paying for the class after all). Learned about Operators, If/Else statement, proper structure of a C program, and setup Code Blocks as my IDE for C.

**Thoughts**: Busy week ahead. Whatever it takes!

### Day 4: January 21, Saturday 1:02AM

**Today's Progress**: Decided to switch gears and add a very basic Twitter feed utilizing Twitter Gem. Got a refreshed on environment variables and the importance of keeping those local/using figaro to hide them. Also had some fun reading through the Twitter Gem docs/watching some vids on how to get the feed setup correctly.

**Thoughts**: I've realized that I simply want SHMEDIUM to be an app where I upload my blogs and share them. I still have a lot of refining to do, and that's fine..but it's coming along quite nicely. Another epiphany I've had is that most of my side projects will be put off until the weekends or on evenings when I'm not in class. It's the only way (at this point) that I feel like I'll get the grades that I want in all of my classes this semester, and I have to be honest with myself. Building this app is something I WANT to do. I don't want to stress myself out and not finish it. So one day at a time from now on. Coding remains fun :)

### Day 3: January 16, Sunday 1:30AM

**Today's Progress**: Watched a bunch of football but I was feeling anxious to make use of Facebook API to authenticate with the SHMEDIUM app. Success! We can now authenticate with facebook credentials. It was a challenge, but I am glad I kept cracking through docs/google/stackoverflow to not only copy/paste code while pulling my hair out..but to learn a bit more about what was happening in my controller..user model..with Devise/Omniauth, and how facebook setup for third-party website logins, isn't as simple as it seems. Good challenge. 

**Thoughts**: My C++ class is around the corner, and so I'm going to try to put a few more hours in to clean up some routes/views and overall logic with SHMEDIUM tomorrow, as I'll be limited with outside of class coding..real soon.

### Day 3: January 14, Friday 4:20PM :)

**Today's Progress**: Pulled up a chair at starbucks for a few hours to read some docs/blog posts on the twitter ruby gem and create a very basic twitter bot that retweets hashtags and can send out tweets.

**Thoughts**: I should have built this sooner! It was a good ruby syntax refresher and now I can finally say I've built (a basic) Twitter bot. Back to SHMEDIUM app refinement and some C++ studying before my class starts next week.

### Day 2: January 13, Thursday 3:00AM

**Today's Progress**: Spent 3 hours integrating User Authentication system via Devise, Omniauth. 95% complete barring a few errors which I will address later this morning. 

**Thoughts**: Proud that I stuck through it. 8 months ago when I was hacking my way through michael hartl's tutorial, I was so very lost. Now, with a few tutorials, meetups, stackoverflow questions and a lot of reading...I'm coming along just fine. Loving it.

### Day 1: January 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent about 5 hours working on front-end features on new blog app project. Cleaned up bootstrap styling, fixed some routing, controller logic, and integrated this really cool gem called medium-editor which made implementing a text editor pretty painless.

**Thoughts**: It took MUCH longer than expected to get the front-end structure to behave the way I wanted it to, but I am somewhat satisifed with the fact that I can say after a few hours, the app is responsive. More work on routing/styling tomorrow.
