# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 13, Thursday 3:00AM

**Today's Progress**: Spent 3 hours integrating User Authentication system via Devise, Omniauth. 95% complete barring a few errors which I will address later this morning. 

**Thoughts**: Proud that I stuck through it. 8 months ago when I was hacking my way through michael hartl's tutorial, I was so very lost. Now, with a few tutorials, meetups, stackoverflow questions and a lot of reading...I'm coming along just fine. Loving it.

### Day 1: January 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent about 5 hours working on front-end features on new blog app project. Cleaned up bootstrap styling, fixed some routing, controller logic, and integrated this really cool gem called medium-editor which made implementing a text editor pretty painless.

**Thoughts**: It took MUCH longer than expected to get the front-end structure to behave the way I wanted it to, but I am somewhat satisifed with the fact that I can say after a few hours, the app is responsive. More work on routing/styling tomorrow.
