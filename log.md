# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 3: January 16, Sunday 1:30AM

**Today's Progress**: Watched a bunch of football but I was feeling anxious to make use of Facebook API to authenticate with the SHMEDIUM app. Success! We can now authenticate with facebook credentials. It was a challenge, but I am glad I kept cracking through docs/google/stackoverflow to not only copy/paste code while pulling my hair out..but to learn a bit more about what was happening in my controller..user model..with Devise/Omniauth, and how facebook setup for third-party website logins, isn't as simple as it seems. Good challenge. 

**Thoughts**: My C++ class is around the corner, and so I'm going to try to put a few more hours in to clean up some routes/views and overall logic with SHMEDIUM tomorrow, as I'll be limited with outside of class coding..real soon.

### Day 3: January 14, Friday 4:20PM :)

**Today's Progress**: Pulled up a chair at starbucks for a few hours to read some docs/blog posts on the twitter ruby gem and create a very basic twitter bot that retweets hashtags and can send out tweets.

**Thoughts**: I should have built this sooner! It was a good ruby syntax refresher and now I can finally say I've built (a basic) Twitter bot. Back to SHMEDIUM app refinement and some C++ studying before my class starts next week.

### Day 2: January 13, Thursday 3:00AM

**Today's Progress**: Spent 3 hours integrating User Authentication system via Devise, Omniauth. 95% complete barring a few errors which I will address later this morning. 

**Thoughts**: Proud that I stuck through it. 8 months ago when I was hacking my way through michael hartl's tutorial, I was so very lost. Now, with a few tutorials, meetups, stackoverflow questions and a lot of reading...I'm coming along just fine. Loving it.

### Day 1: January 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent about 5 hours working on front-end features on new blog app project. Cleaned up bootstrap styling, fixed some routing, controller logic, and integrated this really cool gem called medium-editor which made implementing a text editor pretty painless.

**Thoughts**: It took MUCH longer than expected to get the front-end structure to behave the way I wanted it to, but I am somewhat satisifed with the fact that I can say after a few hours, the app is responsive. More work on routing/styling tomorrow.
