# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day "16": July 2nd, 2017 Sunday, 4:46PM

Today's Progress: Started working on solutions in CTCI. 

Thoughts: Two trig exams down, one more to go and I have the grade that I want in the class so far. Two more weeks and the class is over and I can focus fully on working through CTCI solutions, and taking a stab at leetcode along with continuing to add features to HoopTime, the portfolio portal, and pushing both into production. I plan to go through 1 solution a day. Going through the first one in Arrays and Strings, and finding a solution that I somewhat understood took about 1.5 hours. I'll have to find a way to be more efficient but I think whiteboarding the solutions is going to be necessary prep.

### Day "15": June 26th, 2017 Monday, 9:50PM

Today's Progress: Took a break from HoopTime/the portfolio portal push to production to make a c++ tutorial on functions.

Thoughts: Trig exam tomorrow, but needed to do something related to programming to keep my sanity. I've been meaning to make a new c++ tutorial just to kind of gauge if I've grown in terms of confidence when speaking about this stuff, and compared to my older videos, I can definitely say that I feel more comfortable with the concepts, syntax, what is going on in general. There is always room for improvement, but it feels good to publish some content nonetheless :)

### Day "14": June 24th, 2017 Saturday, 9:50PM

Today's Progress: Desperately trying to push my rails driven portfolio portal site into production. 2 days in playing with procfile, package.json files, resetting buildpacks but Heroku still hates me. 

Thoughts: One exam down and 2 more to go (at least). I'd like to work on getting my portfolio's main portal into production as Summer '18 applications are now approaching the less than 3 month mark. I then am hoping to add some more park data/features to HoopTime and put it into production as well. My goal after this class is over in two weeks will be at least a few pages of CTCI and a LeetCode problem per day, and working on one more smaller app in a different language (likely React). 


### Day "13": June 19th, 2017 Monday, 9:50PM

Today's Progress: Added to local dummy authentication. Cleaned up routes. 

Thoughts: Just got done with the first quiz for my summer trig class. Hoping to add to/finish the authentication feature by the end of the week. 

### Day "12": June 5th, 2017 Monday, 10:49PM

Today's Progress: Beginning authenticatio following example from: http://jasonwatmore.com/post/2015/03/10/angularjs-user-registration-and-login-example-tutorial#authenticationservice

Thoughts: It was also the first day of trig so although I have to focus on that class over the next 6 weeks, I'm going to try and commit about an hour of my evening to completing this authentication project. Wish me luck! 


### Day "11": May 31, 2017 Wednesday, 11:54PM

Today's Progress: Added data to two more parks/finished Lecture 4 of MIT 6.006 Intro to Algorithims - Heaps and Heap Sort

Thoughts: I'm focusing on adding as much Park data before I move onto user log-in/log-out so that users can eventually "check in" to parks and I can find a way to keep check in data/rank users.

### Day "10": May 27, 2017 Saturday, 4:35PM

Today's Progress: Used Angular Seed app as bootstrap for HoopTime

Thoughts: The best way to learn a particular framework/language in my opinion is to create. That being said, I've mocked up how I want the park/court data to display, gone ahead and cleaned up some initial structure, json data to reflect a few parks in elk grove, and added a custom filter (runRating) which rates how "good games" are at given park. More data seeding later. 



### Day "9": May 22, 2017 Monday, 4:44PM

Today's Progress: Refined Shmedium to be central hub for all of my portfolio-related content. (Blog, projects, tutorials,etc)

Thoughts: It's been a few months since I've touched this. Although I have been coding (mainly in C/C++) for school, I haven't been able to play/contribute to my portfolio project. I am planning to use the summer to continue writing, making tutorials, learn angular, participate in meetups, take a summer class.. so this should keep me busy but I am hoping to add a bit more content to the rails-driven site through out the summer months.



### Day 8: February 5, 2017 Monday, 10:50PM

**Today's Progress**: 3 Video walkthroughs on Loops/Loop Patterns in C++ 

**Thoughts**: Had some tough assignments this weekend that I wrapped up this morning along with some great help with my fellow classmates/resources online. C/C++ is challenging, but it's fun. Must. Keep Going.

### Day 7: January 31, Monday, 9:36PM

**Today's Progress**: Part 2 of Video # 1 complete. 

**Thoughts**: Refresher on Geometery, starting to the climb the mountain of C/C++. My legs already hurt.

### Day 5: January 23, Monday, 10:40PM

**Today's Progress**: Full speed ahead with my C Programming class. Taking a break from rails til the weekend most likely, as I want to commit fully to mastering C as much as possible..(I am paying for the class after all). Learned about Operators, If/Else statement, proper structure of a C program, and setup Code Blocks as my IDE for C.

**Thoughts**: Busy week ahead. Whatever it takes!

### Day 4: January 21, Saturday 1:02AM

**Today's Progress**: Decided to switch gears and add a very basic Twitter feed utilizing Twitter Gem. Got a refreshed on environment variables and the importance of keeping those local/using figaro to hide them. Also had some fun reading through the Twitter Gem docs/watching some vids on how to get the feed setup correctly.

**Thoughts**: I've realized that I simply want SHMEDIUM to be an app where I upload my blogs and share them. I still have a lot of refining to do, and that's fine..but it's coming along quite nicely. Another epiphany I've had is that most of my side projects will be put off until the weekends or on evenings when I'm not in class. It's the only way (at this point) that I feel like I'll get the grades that I want in all of my classes this semester, and I have to be honest with myself. Building this app is something I WANT to do. I don't want to stress myself out and not finish it. So one day at a time from now on. Coding remains fun :)

### Day 3: January 16, Sunday 1:30AM

**Today's Progress**: Watched a bunch of football but I was feeling anxious to make use of Facebook API to authenticate with the SHMEDIUM app. Success! We can now authenticate with facebook credentials. It was a challenge, but I am glad I kept cracking through docs/google/stackoverflow to not only copy/paste code while pulling my hair out..but to learn a bit more about what was happening in my controller..user model..with Devise/Omniauth, and how facebook setup for third-party website logins, isn't as simple as it seems. Good challenge. 

**Thoughts**: My C++ class is around the corner, and so I'm going to try to put a few more hours in to clean up some routes/views and overall logic with SHMEDIUM tomorrow, as I'll be limited with outside of class coding..real soon.

### Day 3: January 14, Friday 4:20PM :)

**Today's Progress**: Pulled up a chair at starbucks for a few hours to read some docs/blog posts on the twitter ruby gem and create a very basic twitter bot that retweets hashtags and can send out tweets.

**Thoughts**: I should have built this sooner! It was a good ruby syntax refresher and now I can finally say I've built (a basic) Twitter bot. Back to SHMEDIUM app refinement and some C++ studying before my class starts next week.

### Day 2: January 13, Thursday 3:00AM

**Today's Progress**: Spent 3 hours integrating User Authentication system via Devise, Omniauth. 95% complete barring a few errors which I will address later this morning. 

**Thoughts**: Proud that I stuck through it. 8 months ago when I was hacking my way through michael hartl's tutorial, I was so very lost. Now, with a few tutorials, meetups, stackoverflow questions and a lot of reading...I'm coming along just fine. Loving it.

### Day 1: January 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent about 5 hours working on front-end features on new blog app project. Cleaned up bootstrap styling, fixed some routing, controller logic, and integrated this really cool gem called medium-editor which made implementing a text editor pretty painless.

**Thoughts**: It took MUCH longer than expected to get the front-end structure to behave the way I wanted it to, but I am somewhat satisifed with the fact that I can say after a few hours, the app is responsive. More work on routing/styling tomorrow.
